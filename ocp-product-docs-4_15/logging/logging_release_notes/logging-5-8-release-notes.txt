Logging 5.8

Logging is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy outlines release compatibility.
The stable channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to stable-X where X is the version of logging you have installed.
Logging 5.8.0
This release includes OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.8.0 and OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.8.0 Kibana.

Deprecation notice
In Logging 5.8, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana are deprecated and are planned to be removed in Logging 6.0, which is expected to be shipped alongside a future release of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements. The Vector-based collector provided by the Cluster Logging Operator and LokiStack provided by the Loki Operator are the preferred Operators for log collection and storage. We encourage all users to adopt the Vector and Loki log stack, as this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.
Enhancements
Log Collection
With this update, you can deploy multiple, isolated, and RBAC-protected ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR) instances in any namespace. This allows independent groups to forward desired logs to any destination while isolating their configuration from other collector deployments. (LOG-1343)

With this update, you can use the flow control or rate limiting mechanism to limit the volume of log data that can be collected or forwarded by dropping excess log records. The input limits prevent poorly-performing containers from overloading the Logging subsystem and the output limits put a ceiling on the rate of logs shipped to a given data store. (LOG-884)

With this update, you can configure the log collector to look for HTTP connections and receive logs as an HTTP server, also known as a webhook. (LOG-4562)

With this update, you can configure audit polices to control which Kubernetes and OpenShift API server events are forwarded by the log collector. (LOG-3982)
Log Storage
With this update, LokiStack administrators can have more fine-grained control over who can access which logs by granting access to logs on a namespace basis. (LOG-3841)

With this update, the Loki Operator introduces PodDisruptionBudget configuration on LokiStack deployments to ensure normal operations during "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster restarts by keeping ingestion and the query path available. (LOG-3839)

With this update, the reliability of existing LokiStack installations are seamlessly improved by applying a set of default Affinity and Anti-Affinity policies.
(LOG-3840)

With this update, you can manage zone-aware data replication as an administrator in LokiStack, in order to enhance reliability in the event of a zone failure. (LOG-3266)

With this update, a new supported small-scale LokiStack size of 1x.extra-small is introduced for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters hosting a few workloads and smaller ingestion volumes (up to 100GB/day). (LOG-4329)

With this update, the LokiStack administrator has access to an official Loki dashboard to inspect the storage performance and the health of each component. (LOG-4327)
Log Console
With this update, you can enable the Logging Console Plugin when Elasticsearch is the default Log Store. (LOG-3856)

With this update, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" application owners can receive notifications for application log-based alerts on the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console Developer perspective for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.14 and later. (LOG-3548)
Known Issues
Currently, there is a flaw in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, where you can repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an RST_STREAM frame to cancel it. This created extra work for the server set up and tore down the streams, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (LOG-4609)

Currently, when using  FluentD as the collector, the collector pod cannot start on the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" IPv6-enabled cluster. The pod logs produce the fluentd pod [error]: unexpected error error_class=SocketError error="getaddrinfo: Name or service not known error. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (LOG-4706)

Currently, the log alert is not available on an IPv6-enabled cluster. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (LOG-4709)

Currently, must-gather cannot gather any logs on a FIPS-enabled cluster, because the required OpenSSL library is not available in the cluster-logging-rhel9-operator. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (LOG-4403)

Currently, when deploying the logging subsystem version 5.8 on a FIPS-enabled cluster, the collector pods cannot start and are stuck in CrashLoopBackOff status, while using FluentD as a collector. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (LOG-3933)
