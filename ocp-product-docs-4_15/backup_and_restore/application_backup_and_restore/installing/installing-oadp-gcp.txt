Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection with Google Cloud Platform

You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs Velero 1.11.

Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0.z versions can only be used as a dependency of the MTC Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
You configure GCP for Velero, create a default Secret, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see Installing the OADP Operator.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks for details.
Configuring Google Cloud Platform
You configure Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

You must have the gcloud and gsutil CLI tools installed. See the Google cloud documentation for details.


Log in to GCP:

Set the BUCKET variable:

Create the storage bucket:

Set the PROJECT_ID variable to your active project:

Create a service account:

List your service accounts:

Set the SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL variable to match its email value:

Attach the policies to give the velero user the minimum necessary permissions:

Create the velero.server custom role:

Add IAM policy binding to the project:

Update the IAM service account:

Save the IAM service account keys to the credentials-velero file in the current directory:
About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets
You specify backup and snapshot locations and their secrets in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).


You specify S3-compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO, as a backup location.

Velero backs up "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resources, Kubernetes objects, and internal images as an archive file on object storage.


If you use your cloud provider's native snapshot API to back up persistent volumes, you must specify the cloud provider as the snapshot location.

If you use Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because you will create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.

If you use Restic, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because Restic backs up the file system on object storage.


If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location, you create a default Secret.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create two secret objects:

Custom Secret for the backup location, which you specify in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

Default Secret for the snapshot location, which is not referenced in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


The Data Protection Application requires a default Secret. Otherwise, the installation will fail.

If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file.
Creating a default Secret
You create a default Secret if your backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location.

The default name of the Secret is cloud-credentials-gcp.

The DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) requires a default Secret.  Otherwise, the installation will fail. If the name of the backup location Secret is not specified, the default name is used.

If you do not want to use the backup location credentials during the installation, you can create a Secret with the default name by using an empty credentials-velero file.
Your object storage and cloud storage, if any, must use the same credentials.

You must configure object storage for Velero.

You must create a credentials-velero file for the object storage in the appropriate format.


Create a Secret with the default name:


The Secret is referenced in the spec.backupLocations.credential block of the DataProtectionApplication CR when you install the Data Protection Application.
Creating secrets for different credentials
If your backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secret objects:

Backup location Secret with a custom name. The custom name is specified in the spec.backupLocations block of the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

Snapshot location Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials-gcp. This Secret is not specified in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


Create a credentials-velero file for the snapshot location in the appropriate format for your cloud provider.

Create a Secret for the snapshot location with the default name:

Create a credentials-velero file for the backup location in the appropriate format for your object storage.

Create a Secret for the backup location with a custom name:

Add the Secret with the custom name to the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:
Configuring the Data Protection Application
You can configure the Data Protection Application by setting Velero resource allocations or enabling self-signed CA certificates.

Setting Velero CPU and memory resource allocations
You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the Velero pod by editing the  DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the values in the spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:
Enabling self-signed CA certificates
You must enable a self-signed CA certificate for object storage by editing the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest to prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.caCert parameter and spec.backupLocations.velero.config parameters of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest:
Installing the Data Protection Application
You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

You must install the OADP Operator.

You must configure object storage as a backup location.

If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials-gcp.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secrets:


Click Operators -> Installed Operators and select the OADP Operator.

Under Provided APIs, click Create instance in the DataProtectionApplication box.

Click YAML View and update the parameters of the DataProtectionApplication manifest:

Click Create.

Verify the installation by viewing the OADP resources:


Enabling CSI in the DataProtectionApplication CR
You enable the Container Storage Interface (CSI) in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) in order to back up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots.

The cloud provider must support CSI snapshots.


Edit the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:
