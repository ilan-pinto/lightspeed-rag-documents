Catalogd (Technology Preview)

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 uses the catalogd component and its resources to manage Operator and extension catalogs.

OLM 1.0 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
About catalogs in OLM 1.0
You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.

File-based catalogs


Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs in OLM 1.0
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 does not include Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs by default. If you want to add a Red Hat-provided catalog to your cluster, create a custom resource (CR) for the catalog and apply it to the cluster. The following custom resource (CR) examples show how to create a catalog resources for OLM 1.0.

apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: redhat-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v"4.14"
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: certified-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/certified-operator-index:v"4.14"
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: community-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v"4.14"
The following command adds a catalog to your cluster:

$ oc apply -f <catalog_name>.yaml 1
Specifies the catalog CR, such as redhat-operators.yaml.
