Installing an on-premise cluster using the Assisted Installer

You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on on-premise hardware or on-premise VMs by using the Assisted Installer. Installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" by using the Assisted Installer supports x86_64, AArch64, ppc64le, and s390x CPU architectures.
Using the Assisted Installer
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Assisted Installer is a user-friendly installation solution offered on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. The Assisted Installer supports the various deployment platforms with a focus on bare metal, Nutanix, and vSphere infrastructures.

The Assisted Installer provides installation functionality as a service. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach has the following advantages:

Web user interface: The web user interface performs cluster installation without the user having to create the installation configuration files manually.

No bootstrap node: A bootstrap node is not required when installing with the Assisted Installer. The bootstrapping process executes on a node within the cluster.

Hosting: The Assisted Installer hosts:

Streamlined installation workflow: Deployment does not require in-depth knowledge of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". The Assisted Installer provides reasonable defaults and provides the installer as a service, which:

Advanced networking: The Assisted Installer supports IPv4 networking with SDN and OVN, IPv6 and dual stack networking with OVN only, NMState-based static IP addressing, and an HTTP/S proxy. OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases, but you can use SDN.

Preinstallation validation: The Assisted Installer validates the configuration before installation to ensure a high probability of success. Validation includes:

REST API: The Assisted Installer has a REST API, enabling automation.


The Assisted Installer supports installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on premises in a connected environment, including with an optional HTTP/S proxy. It can install the following:

Highly available "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" or Single Node OpenShift (SNO)

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on bare metal, Nutanix, or vSphere with full platform integration, or other virtualization platforms without integration

Optionally OpenShift Virtualization and OpenShift Data Foundation (formerly OpenShift Container Storage)


The user interface provides an intuitive interactive workflow where automation does not exist or is not required. Users may also automate installations using the REST API.

See Install OpenShift with the Assisted Installer to create an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster with the Assisted Installer. See the Assisted Installer for OpenShift Container Platform documentation for details on using the Assisted Installer.
