Telco RAN reference design specification for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.14"

The Telco RAN reference design specification captures the recommended, tested, and supported configurations to get reliable and repeatable performance for a cluster running the telco RAN DU profile.

These configurations are updated for each major Y-stream release of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". Z-stream patch releases are periodically re-tested against this reference configuration including many long duration validations.
