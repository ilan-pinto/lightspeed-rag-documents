Managing node labeling for obsolete CPU models

You can schedule a virtual machine (VM) on a node as long as the VM CPU model and policy are supported by the node.
About node labeling for obsolete CPU models
The OpenShift Virtualization Operator uses a predefined list of obsolete CPU models to ensure that a node supports only valid CPU models for scheduled VMs.

By default, the following CPU models are eliminated from the list of labels generated for the node:

"486"
Conroe
athlon
core2duo
coreduo
kvm32
kvm64
n270
pentium
pentium2
pentium3
pentiumpro
phenom
qemu32
qemu64
This predefined list is not visible in the HyperConverged CR. You cannot remove CPU models from this list, but you can add to the list by editing the spec.obsoleteCPUs.cpuModels field of the HyperConverged CR.
About node labeling for CPU features
Through the process of iteration, the base CPU features in the minimum CPU model are eliminated from the list of labels generated for the node.

For example:

An environment might have two supported CPU models: Penryn and Haswell.

If Penryn is specified as the CPU model for minCPU, each base CPU feature for Penryn is compared to the list of CPU features supported by Haswell.

If both Penryn and Haswell support a specific CPU feature, a label is not created for that feature. Labels are generated for CPU features that are supported only by Haswell and not by Penryn.
Configuring obsolete CPU models
You can configure a list of obsolete CPU models by editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

Edit the HyperConverged custom resource, specifying the obsolete CPU models in the obsoleteCPUs array. For example:
