Connecting a virtual machine to a service mesh

OpenShift Virtualization is now integrated with OpenShift Service Mesh. You can monitor, visualize, and control traffic between pods that run virtual machine workloads on the default pod network with IPv4.
Adding a virtual machine to a service mesh
To add a virtual machine (VM) workload to a service mesh, enable automatic sidecar injection in the VM configuration file by setting the sidecar.istio.io/inject annotation to true. Then expose your VM as a service to view your application in the mesh.

To avoid port conflicts, do not use ports used by the Istio sidecar proxy. These include ports 15000, 15001, 15006, 15008, 15020, 15021, and 15090.
