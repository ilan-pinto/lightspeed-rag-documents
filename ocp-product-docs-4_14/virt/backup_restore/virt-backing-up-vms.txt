Backing up virtual machines

OADP for OpenShift Virtualization is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
You back up virtual machines (VMs) by creating an OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Backup custom resource (CR).

The Backup CR performs the following actions:

Backs up OpenShift Virtualization resources by creating an archive file on S3-compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway, Noobaa, or Minio.

Backs up VM disks by using one of the following options:


OADP provides backup hooks to freeze the VM file system before the backup operation and unfreeze it when the backup is complete.

The kubevirt-controller creates the virt-launcher pods with annotations that enable Velero to run the virt-freezer binary before and after the backup operation.

The freeze and unfreeze APIs are subresources of the VM snapshot API. See About virtual machine snapshots for details.
You can add hooks to the Backup CR to run commands on specific VMs before or after the backup operation.

You schedule a backup by creating a Schedule CR instead of a Backup CR.
Creating a Backup CR
You back up Kubernetes images, internal images, and persistent volumes (PVs) by creating a Backup custom resource (CR).

You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.

Backup location prerequisites:

Snapshot location prerequisites:


Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs by entering the following command:

Create a Backup CR, as in the following example:

Verify that the status of the Backup CR is Completed:


Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots

You back up persistent volumes with Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots by editing the VolumeSnapshotClass custom resource (CR) of the cloud storage before you create the Backup CR.

The cloud provider must support CSI snapshots.

You must enable CSI in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


Add the metadata.labels.velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: "true" key-value pair to the VolumeSnapshotClass CR:


You can now create a Backup CR.
Backing up applications with Restic
You back up Kubernetes resources, internal images, and persistent volumes with Restic by editing the Backup custom resource (CR).

You do not need to specify a snapshot location in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

Restic does not support backing up hostPath volumes. For more information, see additional Restic limitations.
You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

You must not disable the default Restic installation by setting spec.configuration.restic.enable to false in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.


Edit the Backup CR, as in the following example:
Creating backup hooks
You create backup hooks to run commands in a container in a pod by editing the Backup custom resource (CR).

Pre hooks run before the pod is backed up. Post hooks run after the backup.

Add a hook to the spec.hooks block of the Backup CR, as in the following example:
Scheduling backups
You schedule backups by creating a Schedule custom resource (CR) instead of a Backup CR.

Leave enough time in your backup schedule for a backup to finish before another backup is created.

For example, if a backup of a namespace typically takes 10 minutes, do not schedule backups more frequently than every 15 minutes.
You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.


Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs:

Create a Schedule CR, as in the following example:

Verify that the status of the Schedule CR is Completed after the scheduled backup runs:
