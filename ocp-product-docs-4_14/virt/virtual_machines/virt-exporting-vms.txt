Exporting virtual machines

You can export a virtual machine (VM) and its associated disks in order to import a VM into another cluster or to analyze the volume for forensic purposes.

You create a VirtualMachineExport custom resource (CR) by using the command line interface.

Alternatively, you can use the virtctl vmexport command to create a VirtualMachineExport CR and to download exported volumes.
Creating a VirtualMachineExport custom resource
You can create a VirtualMachineExport custom resource (CR) to export the following objects:

Virtual machine (VM): Exports the persistent volume claims (PVCs) of a specified VM.

VM snapshot: Exports PVCs contained in a VirtualMachineSnapshot CR.

PVC: Exports a PVC. If the PVC is used by another pod, such as the virt-launcher pod, the export remains in a Pending state until the PVC is no longer in use.


The VirtualMachineExport CR creates internal and external links for the exported volumes. Internal links are valid within the cluster. External links can be accessed by using an Ingress or Route.

The export server supports the following file formats:

raw: Raw disk image file.

gzip: Compressed disk image file.

dir: PVC directory and files.

tar.gz: Compressed PVC file.


The VM must be shut down for a VM export.


Create a VirtualMachineExport manifest to export a volume from a VirtualMachine, VirtualMachineSnapshot, or PersistentVolumeClaim CR according to the following example and save it as example-export.yaml:

Create the VirtualMachineExport CR:

Accessing exported virtual machine manifests
After you export a virtual machine (VM) or snapshot, you can get the VirtualMachine manifest and related information from the export server.

You exported a virtual machine or VM snapshot by creating a VirtualMachineExport custom resource (CR).


To access the manifests, you must first copy the certificates from the source cluster to the target cluster.

Decode the token in the source cluster and save it to the token_decode file by running the following command:

Copy the token_decode file to the target cluster.

Get the VirtualMachineExport custom resource by running the following command:

Review the status.links stanza, which is divided into external and internal sections. Note the manifests.url fields within each section:

Log in to the target cluster.

Get the Secret manifest by running the following command:

Get the manifests of type: all, such as the ConfigMap and VirtualMachine manifests, by running the following command:


You can now create the ConfigMap and VirtualMachine objects on the target cluster by using the exported manifests.
