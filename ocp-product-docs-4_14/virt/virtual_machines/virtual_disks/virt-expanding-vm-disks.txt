Expanding virtual machine disks

You can increase the size of a virtual machine (VM) disk by expanding the persistent volume claim (PVC) of the disk.

If your storage provider does not support volume expansion, you can expand the available virtual storage of a VM by adding blank data volumes.

You cannot reduce the size of a VM disk.
Expanding a VM disk PVC
You can increase the size of a virtual machine (VM) disk by expanding the persistent volume claim (PVC) of the disk.

If the PVC uses the file system volume mode, the disk image file expands to the available size while reserving some space for file system overhead.

Edit the PersistentVolumeClaim manifest of the VM disk that you want to expand:

You must have at least one persistent volume.


Create a DataVolume manifest as shown in the following example:

Create the data volume by running the following command:
