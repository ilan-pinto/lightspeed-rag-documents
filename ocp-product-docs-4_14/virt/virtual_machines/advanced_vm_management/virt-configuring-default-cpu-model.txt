Configuring the default CPU model
Use the defaultCPUModel setting in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) to define a cluster-wide default CPU model.

The virtual machine (VM) CPU model depends on the availability of CPU models within the VM and the cluster.

If the VM does not have a defined CPU model:

If both the VM and the cluster have a defined CPU model:

If neither the VM nor the cluster have a defined CPU model:
Configuring the default CPU model
Configure the defaultCPUModel by updating the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). You can change the defaultCPUModel while OpenShift Virtualization is running.

The defaultCPUModel is case sensitive.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Open the HyperConverged CR by running the following command:

Add the defaultCPUModel field to the CR and set the value to the name of a CPU model that exists in the cluster:

Apply the YAML file to your cluster.
