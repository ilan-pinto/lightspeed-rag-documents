About VM templates

Boot sources
You can expedite VM creation by using templates that have an available boot source. Templates with a boot source are labeled Available boot source if they do not have a custom label.
Customization
You can customize the disk source and VM parameters before you start the VM:
Single-node OpenShift
Due to differences in storage behavior, some templates are incompatible with single-node OpenShift. To ensure compatibility, do not set the evictionStrategy field for templates or VMs that use data volumes or storage profiles.
