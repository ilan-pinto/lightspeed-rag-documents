Enabling multicast for a project

About multicast
With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
Multicast traffic between "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" pods is disabled by default. If you are using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.
