Enabling multicast for a project

About multicast
With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
Multicast traffic between "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" pods is disabled by default. If you are using the OpenShift SDN network plugin, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.

When using the OpenShift SDN network plugin in networkpolicy isolation mode:

Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the project, regardless of NetworkPolicy objects. Pods might be able to communicate over multicast even when they cannot communicate over unicast.

Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will never be delivered to pods in any other project, even if there are NetworkPolicy objects that allow communication between the projects.


When using the OpenShift SDN network plugin in multitenant isolation mode:

Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the
project.

Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will be delivered to pods in
other projects only if each project is joined together and multicast is enabled
in each joined project.
Enabling multicast between pods
You can enable multicast between pods for your project.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin
role.


Run the following command to enable multicast for a project. Replace <namespace> with the namespace for the project you want to enable multicast for.


To verify that multicast is enabled for a project, complete the following procedure:

Change your current project to the project that you enabled multicast for. Replace <project> with the project name.

Create a pod to act as a multicast receiver:

Create a pod to act as a multicast sender:

In a new terminal window or tab, start the multicast listener.

Start the multicast transmitter.
