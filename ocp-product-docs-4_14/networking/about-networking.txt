About networking

Red Hat OpenShift Networking is an ecosystem of features, plugins and advanced networking capabilities that extend Kubernetes networking with the advanced networking-related features that your cluster needs to manage its network traffic for one or multiple hybrid clusters. This ecosystem of networking capabilities integrates ingress, egress, load balancing, high-performance throughput, security, inter- and intra-cluster traffic management and provides role-based observability tooling to reduce its natural complexities.

The following list highlights some of the most commonly used Red Hat OpenShift Networking features available on your cluster:

Primary cluster network provided by either of the following Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins:

Certified 3rd-party alternative primary network plugins

Cluster Network Operator for network plugin management

Ingress Operator for TLS encrypted web traffic

DNS Operator for name assignment

MetalLB Operator for traffic load balancing on bare metal clusters

IP failover support for high-availability

Additional hardware network support through multiple CNI plugins, including for macvlan, ipvlan, and SR-IOV hardware networks

IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack addressing

Hybrid Linux-Windows host clusters for Windows-based workloads

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh for discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring of services

Single-node OpenShift

Network Observability Operator for network debugging and insights

Submariner and Red Hat Application Interconnect technologies for inter-cluster networking
