Configuring community alias

As a cluster administrator, you can configure a community alias and use it across different advertisements.
About the community custom resource
The community custom resource is a collection of aliases for communities. Users can define named aliases to be used when advertising ipAddressPools using the BGPAdvertisement. The fields for the community custom resource are described in the following table.

The community CRD applies only to BGPAdvertisement.
Configuring MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and community alias
Configure MetalLB as follows so that the IPAddressPool is advertised with the BGP protocol and the community alias set to the numeric value of the NO_ADVERTISE community.

In the following example, the peer BGP router doc-example-peer-community receives one 203.0.113.200/32 route and one fc00:f853:ccd:e799::1/128 route for each load-balancer IP address that MetalLB assigns to a service. A community alias is configured with the NO_ADVERTISE community.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create an IP address pool.

Create a community alias named community1.

Create a BGP peer named doc-example-bgp-peer.
