Preparing to install on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE

Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.

Before you begin the installation process, you must clean the installation directory. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.

You provisioned persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with ReadWriteMany access.

If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.


While this document refers only to IBM Z&#174;, all information in it also applies to IBM&#174; LinuxONE.
Choosing a method to install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE
You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with the Assisted Installer. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like IBM Z&#174;. See Installing an on-premise cluster using the Assisted Installer for additional details.

You can also install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on infrastructure that you provide. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See the Installation process for more information about Assisted Installer and user-provisioned installation processes.

The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the IBM Z&#174; platform and the installation process of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
User-provisioned infrastructure installation of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on IBM Z
User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z&#174; and IBM&#174; LinuxONE: You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with z/VM on IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.

Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z&#174; and IBM&#174; LinuxONE in a restricted network: You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with z/VM on IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network, by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.

Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z&#174; and IBM&#174; LinuxONE: You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with KVM on IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.

Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z&#174; and IBM&#174; LinuxONE in a restricted network: You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with RHEL KVM on IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network, by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
