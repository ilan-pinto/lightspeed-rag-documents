Scaling a user-provisioned cluster with the Bare Metal Operator

After deploying a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster, you can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and other metal3 components to scale bare-metal hosts in the cluster. This approach helps you to scale a user-provisioned cluster in a more automated way.
About scaling a user-provisioned cluster with the Bare Metal Operator
You can scale user-provisioned infrastructure clusters by using the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and other metal3 components. User-provisioned infrastructure installations do not feature the Machine API Operator. The Machine API Operator typically manages the lifecycle of bare-metal hosts in a cluster. However, it is possible to use the BMO and other metal3 components to scale nodes in user-provisioned clusters without requiring the Machine API Operator.

Prerequisites for scaling a user-provisioned cluster
You installed a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster on bare metal.

You have baseboard management controller (BMC) access to the hosts.
Limitations for scaling a user-provisioned cluster
You cannot use a provisioning network to scale user-provisioned infrastructure clusters by using the Bare Metal Operator (BMO).

You cannot scale MachineSet objects in user-provisioned infrastructure clusters by using the BMO.
Configuring a provisioning resource to scale user-provisioned clusters
Create a Provisioning custom resource (CR) to enable Metal platform components on a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster.

You installed a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster on bare metal.


Create a Provisioning CR.

Create the Provisioning CR by running the following command:


Verify that the provisioning service is running by running the following command:
Provisioning new hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO
You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to provision bare-metal hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by creating a BareMetalHost custom resource (CR).

To provision bare-metal hosts to the cluster by using the BMO, you must set the spec.externallyProvisioned specification in the BareMetalHost custom resource to false.
You created a user-provisioned bare-metal cluster.

You have baseboard management controller (BMC) access to the hosts.

You deployed a provisioning service in the cluster by creating a Provisioning CR.


Create the Secret CR and the BareMetalHost CR.

Create the bare-metal host object by running the following command:

Approve all certificate signing requests (CSRs).


Verify that the node is ready by running the following command:
Optional: Managing existing hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO
Optionally, you can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to manage existing bare-metal controller hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by creating a BareMetalHost object for the existing host. It is not a requirement to manage existing user-provisioned hosts; however, you can enroll them as externally-provisioned hosts for inventory purposes.

To manage existing hosts by using the BMO, you must set the spec.externallyProvisioned specification in the BareMetalHost custom resource to true to prevent the BMO from re-provisioning the host.
You created a user-provisioned bare-metal cluster.

You have baseboard management controller (BMC) access to the hosts.

You deployed a provisioning service in the cluster by creating a Provisioning CR.


Create the Secret CR and the BareMetalHost CR.

Create the bare-metal host object by running the following command:


Verify that the BMO created the bare-metal host object by running the following command:
Removing hosts from a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO
You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to remove bare-metal hosts from a user-provisioned cluster.

You created a user-provisioned bare-metal cluster.

You have baseboard management controller (BMC) access to the hosts.

You deployed a provisioning service in the cluster by creating a Provisioning CR.


Cordon and drain the host by running the following command:

Delete the customDeploy specification from the BareMetalHost CR.

Delete the node by running the following command:


Verify the node is deleted by running the following command:
