Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 2.7

Distributed tracing overview
As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture. You can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

With the distributed tracing platform, you can perform the following functions:

Monitor distributed transactions

Optimize performance and latency

Perform root cause analysis


The distributed tracing platform consists of three components:

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), which is based on the open source Jaeger project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo), which is based on the open source Grafana Tempo project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection, which is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project.


Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.

Making open source more inclusive
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
