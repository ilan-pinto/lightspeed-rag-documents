Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 2.0

Distributed tracing overview
As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture. You can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

With the distributed tracing platform, you can perform the following functions:

Monitor distributed transactions

Optimize performance and latency

Perform root cause analysis


The distributed tracing platform consists of three components:

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), which is based on the open source Jaeger project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo), which is based on the open source Grafana Tempo project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection, which is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project.


Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.
Component versions in the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 2.0.0

New features and enhancements
This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

Rebrands Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger as the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform.

Updates Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform will only support the stable Operator channel.
Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OperatorHub.

Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.
Technology Preview features
This release adds the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection as a Technology Preview, which you install using the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator. Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection is based on the OpenTelemetry APIs and instrumentation. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
Bug fixes
This release addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.

Making open source more inclusive
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
