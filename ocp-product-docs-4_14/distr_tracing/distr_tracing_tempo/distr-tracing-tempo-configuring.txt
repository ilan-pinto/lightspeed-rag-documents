Configuring and deploying the distributed tracing platform (Tempo)

The Tempo Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) file that defines the architecture and configuration settings to be used when creating and deploying the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) resources. You can install the default configuration or modify the file.
Customizing your deployment
Distributed tracing default configuration options
The Tempo custom resource (CR) defines the architecture and settings to be used when creating the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) resources. You can modify these parameters to customize your distributed tracing platform (Tempo) implementation to your business needs.

apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: name
spec:
  storage: {}
  resources: {}
  storageSize: 200M
  replicationFactor: 1
  retention: {}
  template:
      distributor:{}
      ingester: {}
      compactor: {}
      querier: {}
      queryFrontend: {}
      gateway: {}

The following is the required minimum for creating a distributed tracing platform (Tempo) deployment with the default settings:

apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: simplest
spec:
  storage: 1
    secret:
      name: minio
      type: s3
  resources:
    total:
      limits:
        memory: 2Gi
        cpu: 2000m
  template:
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:
        enabled: true
        ingress:
          type: route
This section specifies the deployed object storage back end, which requires a created secret with credentials for access to the object storage.
The distributed tracing platform (Tempo) storage configuration
You can configure object storage for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) in the TempoStack custom resource under spec.storage. You can choose from among several storage providers that are supported.
Query configuration options
Query is a service that retrieves traces from storage and hosts the user interface to display them.



apiVersion: tempotracing.io/v1
kind: "Tempo"
metadata:
  name: "my-tempo"
spec:
  strategy: allInOne
  allInOne:
    options:
      log-level: debug
      query:
        base-path: /tempo
Setting up monitoring for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo)
The Tempo Operator supports monitoring and alerting of each TempoStack component such as distributor, ingester, and so on, and exposes upgrade and operational metrics about the Operator itself.

Configuring TempoStack metrics and alerts
You can enable metrics and alerts of TempoStack instances.

Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled in the cluster. See Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects.


To enable metrics of a TempoStack instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors field to true:

To enable alerts for a TempoStack instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.createPrometheusRules field to true:


You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

Go to Observe -> Targets, filter for Source: User, and check that ServiceMonitors in the format tempo-<instance_name>-<component> have the Up status.

To verify that alerts are set up correctly, go to Observe -> Alerting -> Alerting rules, filter for Source: User, and check that the Alert rules for the TempoStack instance components are available.
Configuring Tempo Operator metrics and alerts
When installing the Tempo Operator from the web console, you can select the Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace checkbox, which enables creating metrics and alerts of the Tempo Operator.

If the checkbox was not selected during installation, you can manually enable metrics and alerts even after installing the Tempo Operator.

Add the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the project where the Tempo Operator is installed, which is openshift-tempo-operator by default.


You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

Go to Observe -> Targets, filter for Source: Platform, and search for tempo-operator, which must have the Up status.

To verify that alerts are set up correctly, go to Observe -> Alerting -> Alerting rules, filter for Source: Platform, and locate the Alert rules for the Tempo Operator.
