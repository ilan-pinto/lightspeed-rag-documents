Log output types

Log outputs specified in the ClusterLogForwarder CR can be any of the following types:


default
The on-cluster, Red Hat managed log store. You are not required to configure the default output.
loki
Loki, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system.
kafka
A Kafka broker. The kafka output can use a TCP or TLS connection.
elasticsearch
An external Elasticsearch instance. The elasticsearch output can use a TLS connection.
fluentdForward
An external log aggregation solution that supports Fluentd. This option uses the Fluentd forward protocols. The fluentForward output can use a TCP or TLS connection and supports shared-key authentication by providing a shared_key field in a secret. Shared-key authentication can be used with or without TLS.
syslog
An external log aggregation solution that supports the syslog RFC3164 or RFC5424 protocols. The syslog output can use a UDP, TCP, or TLS connection.
cloudwatch
Amazon CloudWatch, a monitoring and log storage service hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Supported log data output types in OpenShift Logging 5.7
Red Hat OpenShift Logging 5.7 provides the following output types and protocols for sending log data to target log collectors.
