Network flows format reference

These are the specifications for network flows format, used both internally and when exporting flows to Kafka.
Network Flows format reference
This is the specification of the network flows format, used both internally and when exporting flows to Kafka.

The document is organized in two main categories: Labels and regular Fields. This distinction only matters when querying Loki. This is because Labels, unlike Fields, must be used in stream selectors.

If you are reading this specification as a reference for the Kafka export feature, you must treat all Labels and Fields as regular fields and ignore any distinctions between them that are specific to Loki.

Labels
