Disabling the control plane machine set

The .spec.state field in an activated ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) cannot be changed from Active to Inactive. To disable the control plane machine set, you must delete the CR so that it is removed from the cluster.

When you delete the CR, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator performs cleanup operations and disables the control plane machine set. The Operator then removes the CR from the cluster and creates an inactive control plane machine set with default settings.
Deleting the control plane machine set
To stop managing control plane machines with the control plane machine set on your cluster, you must delete the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR).

Delete the control plane machine set CR by running the following command:


Check the control plane machine set custom resource state. A result of Inactive indicates that the removal and replacement process is successful. A ControlPlaneMachineSet CR exists but is not activated.
Checking the control plane machine set custom resource state
You can verify the existence and state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR).

Determine the state of the CR by running the following command:
Re-enabling the control plane machine set
To re-enable the control plane machine set, you must ensure that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster and activate it.
