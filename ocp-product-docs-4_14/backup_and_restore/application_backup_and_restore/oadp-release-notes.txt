The release notes for OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, product recommendations, known issues, and resolved issues.
OADP 1.2.3 release notes
New features
There are no new features in the release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2.3.
Resolved issues
The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.3:

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following Jira list.

For more information, see CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack).

OADP 1.2.2 release notes
New features
There are no new features in the release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2.2.
Resolved issues
The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.2:

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 enforced a pod security admission (PSA) policy that hindered the readiness of pods during a Restic restore process.

This issue has been resolved in the release of OADP 1.2.2, and also OADP 1.1.6. Therefore, it is recommended that users upgrade to these releases.

For more information, see Restic restore partially failing on OCP 4.14 due to changed PSA policy. (OADP-2094)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, the backup of an application with internal images partially failed with plugin panicked error returned. The backup partially fails with this error in the Velero logs:

time="2022-11-23T15:40:46Z" level=info msg="1 errors encountered backup up item" backup=openshift-adp/django-persistent-67a5b83d-6b44-11ed-9cba-902e163f806c logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:413" name=django-psql-persistent
time="2022-11-23T15:40:46Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/django-persistent-67a5b83d-6b44-11ed-9cba-902e163f8
This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.2.2. (OADP-1057).

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, ACM cluster restore was not functioning as expected due to restore order. ACM applications were removed and re-created on managed clusters after restore activation. (OADP-2505)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, due to storage provider implementation choices, whenever there was a difference between the application persistent volume claims (PVCs) storage request and the snapshot size of the same PVC, VM's using filesystemOverhead failed when backing up and restoring.Â This issue has been resolved in the Data Mover of OADP 1.2.2. (OADP-2144)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, there was no option to set the VolSync replication source pruneInterval. (OADP-2052)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, there was a possibility of pod volume backup failure if Velero was installed in multiple namespaces. (OADP-2409)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, Backup Storage Locations moved to unavailable phase when Volume Snapshot Location used custom secret. (OADP-1737)

For a complete list of all issues resolved in the release of OADP 1.2.2, see the list of OADP 1.2.2 resolved issues in Jira.
Known issues
The following issues have been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.2:

The oc adm must-gather command fails to remove ClusterRoleBinding resources, which are left on cluster due to admission webhook. Therefore, requests for the removal of the ClusterRoleBinding resources are denied. (OADP-27730)

admission webhook "clusterrolebindings-validation.managed.openshift.io" denied the request: Deleting ClusterRoleBinding must-gather-p7vwj is not allowed

OADP 1.2.1 release notes
New features
There are no new features in the release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2.1.
Resolved issues

Known issues
The following issues have been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.1:

The retention and prune features provided by VolSync and Restic are not working as expected. Because there is no working option to set the prune interval on VolSync replication, you have to manage and prune remotely stored backups on S3 storage outside of OADP. For more details, see:

OADP 1.2.0 release notes
The OADP 1.2.0 release notes include information about new features, bug fixes, and known issues.

New features
The new resourceTimeout option specifies the timeout duration in minutes for waiting on various Velero resources. This option applies to resources such as Velero CRD availability, volumeSnapshot deletion, and backup repository availability. The default duration is 10 minutes.

You can back up objects and snapshots on AWS S3 compatible providers.

Technical preview features
The OADP Data Mover enables you to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When you enable Data Mover, you can restore stateful applications using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store in case of accidental cluster deletion, cluster failure, or data corruption.

Resolved issues
The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.1.7:

In previous releases of OADP 1.1, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following Jira list.

Known issues

OADP 1.1.6 release notes
The OADP 1.1.6 release notes lists any new features, resolved issues and bugs, and known issues.

Resolved issues
OCP 4.14 introduced pod security standards that meant the privileged profile is enforced. In previous releases of OADP, this profile caused the pod to receive permission denied errors. This issue was caused because of the restore order. The pod was created before the security context constraints (SCC) resource. As this pod violated the pod security standard, the pod was denied and subsequently failed. OADP-2420

In previous releases of OADP, the restore of job resource was partially failing in OCP 4.14. This issue was not seen in older OCP versions. The issue was caused by an additional label being to the job resource, which was not present in older OCP versions. OADP-2530

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.1.6 resolved issues in Jira.
Known issues

OADP 1.1.4 release notes
The OADP 1.1.4 release notes lists any new features, resolved issues and bugs, and known issues.

New features
This version of OADP is a service release. No new features are added to this version.
Resolved issues
In previous releases of OADP, OADP did not facilitate the support of all the upstream Velero server arguments. This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.1.4 and all the upstream Velero server arguments are supported. OADP-1557

In previous releases of OADP, OADP Data Mover could restore from an incorrect snapshot if there was more than one Volume Snapshot Restore (VSR) resource in the cluster for the same Velero restore name and PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) name. OADP-1822

In previous releases of OADP, ACM BackupSchedules failed validation because of a missing OwnerReference on Backup Storage Locations (BSLs) created with dpa.spec.backupLocations.bucket. OADP-1511

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.1.4 resolved issues in Jira.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not back up and restore "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" UID/GID range metadata. To avoid the issue, if the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. An additional workaround is to allow OADP to create the namespace in the restore operation.

A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD, app.kubernetes.io/instance. This label identifies which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create a conflict with OADP's procedure for managing resources on restoration. To work around this issue, set .spec.resourceTrackingMethod on the ArgoCD YAML to annotation+label or annotation. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning to restore, and enable it again when restoration is finished.
