Scheduling backups using Schedule CR

The schedule operation allows you to create a backup of your data at a specified time, defined by a Cron expression.

You schedule backups by creating a Schedule custom resource (CR) instead of a Backup CR.

Leave enough time in your backup schedule for a backup to finish before another backup is created.

For example, if a backup of a namespace typically takes 10 minutes, do not schedule backups more frequently than every 15 minutes.
You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.

Create a Schedule CR, as in the following example:

Verify that the status of the Schedule CR is Completed after the scheduled backup runs:
