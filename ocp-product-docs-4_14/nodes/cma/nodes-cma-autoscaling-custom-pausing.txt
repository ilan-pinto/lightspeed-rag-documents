Pausing the custom metrics autoscaler for a scaled object

You can pause and restart the autoscaling of a workload, as needed.

For example, you might want to pause autoscaling before performing cluster maintenance or to avoid resource starvation by removing non-mission-critical workloads.
Pausing a custom metrics autoscaler
You can pause the autoscaling of a scaled object by adding the autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas annotation to the custom metrics autoscaler for that scaled object. The custom metrics autoscaler scales the replicas for that workload to the specified value and pauses autoscaling until the annotation is removed.

apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas: "4"
# ...
Use the following command to edit the ScaledObject CR for your workload:

Add the autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas annotation with any value:
Restarting the custom metrics autoscaler for a scaled object
You can restart a paused custom metrics autoscaler by removing the autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas annotation for that ScaledObject.

apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas: "4"
# ...
Use the following command to edit the ScaledObject CR for your workload:

Remove the autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas annotation.
