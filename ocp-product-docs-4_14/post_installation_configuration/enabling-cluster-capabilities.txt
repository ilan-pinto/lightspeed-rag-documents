Enabling cluster capabilities

Cluster administrators can enable cluster capabilities that were disabled prior to installation.

Cluster administrators cannot disable a cluster capability after it is enabled.
Viewing the cluster capabilities
As a cluster administrator, you can view the capabilities by using the clusterversion resource status.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


To view the status of the cluster capabilities, run the following command:
Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting baseline capability set
As a cluster administrator, you can enable the capabilities by setting baselineCapabilitySet.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


To set the baselineCapabilitySet, run the following command:


The following table describes the baselineCapabilitySet values.
Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting additional enabled capabilities
As a cluster administrator, you can enable the cluster capabilities by setting additionalEnabledCapabilities.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


View the additional enabled capabilities by running the following command:

To set the additionalEnabledCapabilities, run the following command:


It is not possible to disable a capability which is already enabled in a cluster. The cluster version Operator (CVO) continues to reconcile the capability which is already enabled in the cluster.
If you try to disable a capability, then CVO shows the divergent spec:

$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities")]}{"\n"}'
{"lastTransitionTime":"2022-07-22T03:14:35Z","message":"The following capabilities could not be disabled: openshift-samples","reason":"CapabilitiesImplicitlyEnabled","status":"True","type":"ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities"}
During the cluster upgrades, it is possible that a given capability could be implicitly enabled. If a resource was already running on the cluster before the upgrade, then any capabilities that is part of the resource will be enabled. For example, during a cluster upgrade, a resource that is already running on the cluster has been changed to be part of the marketplace capability by the system. Even if a cluster administrator does not explicitly enabled the marketplace capability, it is implicitly enabled by the system.
