Editing kubelet log level verbosity and gathering logs

To troubleshoot some issues with nodes, establish the kubelet's log level verbosity depending on the issue to be tracked.
Modifying the kubelet as a one-time scenario
To modify the kubelet in a one-time scenario without rebooting the node due to the change of machine-config(spec":{"paused":false}}), allowing you to modify the kubelet without affecting the service, follow this procedure.

Connect to the node in debug mode:

After access is established, check the default log level:

Define the new verbosity required in a new /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/30-logging.conf file, which overrides /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-logging.conf. In this example, the verbosity is changed from 2 to 8:

Reload systemd and restart the service:

Gather the logs, and then revert the log level increase:
Persistent kubelet log level configuration
Use the following MachineConfig object for persistent kubelet log level configuration:
Log verbosity descriptions

Gathering kubelet logs
After the kubelet's log level verbosity is configured properly, you can gather logs by running the following commands:

To collect master container logs, run the following command:

To directly gather the logs of all nodes, run the following command:
