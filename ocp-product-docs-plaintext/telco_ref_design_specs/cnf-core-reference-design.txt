Telco core reference design specification for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}

The telco core reference design specification captures the recommended, tested, and supported configurations to get reliable and repeatable performance for a telco core cluster. The telco core reference design provides a platform that supports large scale telecom applications including control plane and some centralized data plane functions running on commodity hardware. These functions generally require scalability, complex networking support, resilient software-defined storage, and support performance requirements that are less stringent and constrained than far-edge RAN deployments.

These configurations are updated for each major Y-stream release of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". Z-stream patch releases are periodically re-tested against this reference configuration including many long duration validations.
