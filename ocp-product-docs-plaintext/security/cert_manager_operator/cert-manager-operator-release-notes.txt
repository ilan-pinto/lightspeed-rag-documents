Bug fixes
Previously, you could not configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components such as cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook. Now, you can configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components by using the command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see Overriding CPU and memory limits for the cert-manager components. (OCPBUGS-13830)

Previously, if you updated the ClusterIssuer object, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift could not verify and update the change in the cluster issuer. Now, if you modify the ClusterIssuer object, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift verifies the ACME account registration and updates the change. (OCPBUGS-8210)

Previously, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift did not support enabling the  --enable-certificate-owner-ref flag. Now, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports enabling the --enable-certificate-owner-ref flag by adding the spec.controllerConfig.overrideArgs field in the cluster object. After enabling the --enable-certificate-owner-ref flag, cert-manager can automatically delete the secret when the Certificate resource is removed from the cluster. For more information on enabling the --enable-certificate-owner-ref flag and deleting the TLS secret automatically, see Deleting a TLS secret automatically upon Certificate removal (CM-98)

Previously, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift could not pull the jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1 image. The cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods were stuck in the ImagePullBackOff state. Now, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift pulls the jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1 image to run the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods successfully.
