Configuring interface-level network sysctls

In Linux, sysctl allows an administrator to modify kernel parameters at runtime. You can modify interface-level network sysctls using the tuning Container Network Interface (CNI) meta plugin. The tuning CNI meta plugin operates in a chain with a main CNI plugin as illustrated.


The main CNI plugin assigns the interface and passes this to the tuning CNI meta plugin at runtime. You can change some sysctls and several interface attributes (promiscuous mode, all-multicast mode, MTU, and MAC address) in the network namespace by using the tuning CNI meta plugin.  In the tuning CNI meta plugin configuration, the interface name is represented by the IFNAME token, and is replaced with the actual name of the interface at runtime.

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", the tuning CNI meta plugin only supports changing interface-level network sysctls.
Configuring the tuning CNI
The following procedure configures the tuning CNI to change the interface-level network net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects sysctl. This example enables accepting and sending ICMP-redirected packets.

Create a network attachment definition, such as tuning-example.yaml, with the following content:

Apply the yaml by running the following command:

Create a pod such as examplepod.yaml with the network attachment definition similar to the following:

Apply the yaml by running the following command:

Verify that the pod is created by running the following command:

Log in to the pod by running the following command:

Verify the values of the configured sysctl flags. For example, find the value net.ipv4.conf.net1.accept_redirects by running the following command:
