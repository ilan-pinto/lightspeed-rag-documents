Configuring an SR-IOV Ethernet network attachment

You can configure an Ethernet network attachment for an Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) device in the cluster.
Ethernet device configuration object
You can configure an Ethernet network device by defining an SriovNetwork object.

The following YAML describes an SriovNetwork object:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: <name> 1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator 2
spec:
  resourceName: <sriov_resource_name> 3
  networkNamespace: <target_namespace> 4
  vlan: <vlan> 5
  spoofChk: "<spoof_check>" 6
  ipam: |- 7
    {}
  linkState: <link_state> 8
  maxTxRate: <max_tx_rate> 9
  minTxRate: <min_tx_rate> 10
  vlanQoS: <vlan_qos> 11
  trust: "<trust_vf>" 12
  capabilities: <capabilities> 13
A name for the object. The SR-IOV Network Operator creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object with same name.

The namespace where the SR-IOV Network Operator is installed.

The value for the spec.resourceName parameter from the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object that defines the SR-IOV hardware for this additional network.

The target namespace for the SriovNetwork object. Only pods in the target namespace can attach to the additional network.

Optional: A Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID for the additional network. The integer value must be from 0 to 4095. The default value is 0.

Optional: The spoof check mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings "on" and "off".

A configuration object for the IPAM CNI plugin as a YAML block scalar. The plugin manages IP address assignment for the attachment definition.

Optional: The link state of virtual function (VF). Allowed value are enable, disable and auto.

Optional: A maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF.

Optional: A minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This value must be less than or equal to the maximum transmission rate.

Optional: An IEEE 802.1p priority level for the VF. The default value is 0.

Optional: The trust mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings "on" and "off".

Optional: The capabilities to configure for this additional network. You can specify "{ "ips": true }" to enable IP address support or "{ "mac": true }" to enable MAC address support.


Configuration of IP address assignment for an additional network
The IP address management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin provides IP addresses for other CNI plugins.

You can use the following IP address assignment types:

Static assignment.

Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.

Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.


Static IP address assignment configuration
The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:


The addresses array requires objects with the following fields:




{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "static",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "address": "191.168.1.7/24"
        }
      ]
  }
}
Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration
The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

The SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; The Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: dhcp-shim
    namespace: default
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
        "name": "dhcp-shim",
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "type": "bridge",
        "ipam": {
          "type": "dhcp"
        }
      }
  # ...

{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
  }
}
Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts
The Whereabouts CNI plugin allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

The following table describes the configuration for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:


{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "whereabouts",
    "range": "192.0.2.192/27",
    "exclude": [
       "192.0.2.192/30",
       "192.0.2.196/32"
    ]
  }
}
Creating a Whereabouts reconciler daemon set
The Whereabouts reconciler is responsible for managing dynamic IP address assignments for the pods within a cluster using the Whereabouts IP Address Management (IPAM) solution. It ensures that each pods gets a unique IP address from the specified IP address range. It also handles IP address releases when pods are deleted or scaled down.

You can also use a NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource for dynamic IP address assignment.
The Whereabouts reconciler daemon set is automatically created when you configure an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator. It is not automatically created when you configure an additional network from a YAML manifest.

To trigger the deployment of the Whereabouts reconciler daemonset, you must manually create a whereabouts-shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator custom resource file.

Use the following procedure to deploy the Whereabouts reconciler daemonset.

Edit the Network.operator.openshift.io custom resource (CR) by running the following command:

Modify the additionalNetworks parameter in the CR to add the whereabouts-shim network attachment definition. For example:

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Verify that the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set deployed successfully by running the following command:
Creating a configuration for assignment of dual-stack IP addresses dynamically
Dual-stack IP address assignment can be configured with the ipRanges parameter for:

IPv4 addresses

IPv6 addresses

multiple IP address assignment


Set type to whereabouts.

Use ipRanges to allocate IP addresses as shown in the following example:

Attach network to a pod. For more information, see "Adding a pod to an additional network".

Verify that all IP addresses are assigned.

Run the following command to ensure the IP addresses are assigned as metadata.


Attaching a pod to an additional network
Configuring SR-IOV additional network
You can configure an additional network that uses SR-IOV hardware by creating an SriovNetwork object. When you create an SriovNetwork object, the SR-IOV Network Operator automatically creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.

Do not modify or delete an SriovNetwork object if it is attached to any pods in a running state.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a SriovNetwork object, and then save the YAML in the <name>.yaml file, where <name> is a name for this additional network. The object specification might resemble the following example:

To create the object, enter the following command:

Optional: To confirm that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object that is associated with the SriovNetwork object that you created in the previous step exists, enter the following command. Replace <namespace> with the networkNamespace you specified in the SriovNetwork object.
