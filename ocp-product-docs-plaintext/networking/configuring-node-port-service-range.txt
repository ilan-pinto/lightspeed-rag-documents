Configuring the node port service range

As a cluster administrator, you can expand the available node port range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, you might need to increase the number of available ports.

The default port range is 30000-32767. You can never reduce the port range, even if you first expand it beyond the default range.
Prerequisites
Your cluster infrastructure must allow access to the ports that you specify within the expanded range. For example, if you expand the node port range to 30000-32900, the inclusive port range of 32768-32900 must be allowed by your firewall or packet filtering configuration.
Expanding the node port range
You can expand the node port range for the cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.


To expand the node port range, enter the following command. Replace <port> with the largest port number in the new range.

To confirm that the configuration is active, enter the following command. It can take several minutes for the update to apply.
