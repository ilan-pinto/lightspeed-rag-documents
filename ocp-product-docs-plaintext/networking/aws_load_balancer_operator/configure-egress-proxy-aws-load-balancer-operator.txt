Configuring cluster-wide proxy

You can configure the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator. After configuring the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates all the deployments of the Operators with the environment variables such as HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. These variables are populated to the managed controller by the AWS Load Balancer Operator.
Configuring the AWS Load Balancer Operator to trust the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy
Create the config map to contain the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the aws-load-balancer-operator namespace and inject a CA bundle that is trusted by "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" into a config map by running the following command:

To inject the trusted CA bundle into the config map, add the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label to the config map by running the following command:

Update the subscription of the AWS Load Balancer Operator to access the config map in the deployment of the AWS Load Balancer Operator by running the following command:

After the deployment of the AWS Load Balancer Operator is completed, verify that the CA bundle is added to the aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager deployment by running the following command:

Optional: Restart deployment of the AWS Load Balancer Operator every time the config map changes by running the following command:
