Verifying connectivity to an endpoint

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) runs a controller, the connectivity check controller, that performs a connection health check between resources within your cluster. By reviewing the results of the health checks, you can diagnose connection problems or eliminate network connectivity as the cause of an issue that you are investigating.
Connection health checks performed
To verify that cluster resources are reachable, a TCP connection is made to each of the following cluster API services:

Kubernetes API server service

Kubernetes API server endpoints

OpenShift API server service

OpenShift API server endpoints

Load balancers


To verify that services and service endpoints are reachable on every node in the cluster, a TCP connection is made to each of the following targets:

Health check target service

Health check target endpoints
Implementation of connection health checks
The connectivity check controller orchestrates connection verification checks in your cluster. The results for the connection tests are stored in PodNetworkConnectivity objects in the openshift-network-diagnostics namespace. Connection tests are performed every minute in parallel.

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys several resources to the cluster to send and receive connectivity health checks:


Health check source
This program deploys in a single pod replica set managed by a Deployment object. The program consumes PodNetworkConnectivity objects and connects to the spec.targetEndpoint specified in each object.
Health check target
A pod deployed as part of a daemon set on every node in the cluster. The pod listens for inbound health checks. The presence of this pod on every node allows for the testing of connectivity to each node.
PodNetworkConnectivityCheck object fields
The PodNetworkConnectivityCheck object fields are described in the following tables.


The following table describes the fields for objects in the status.conditions array:


The following table describes the fields for objects in the status.conditions array:



The fields for a connection log entry are described in the following table. The object is used in the following fields:

status.failures[]

status.successes[]

status.outages[].startLogs[]

status.outages[].endLogs[]
Verifying network connectivity for an endpoint
As a cluster administrator, you can verify the connectivity of an endpoint, such as an API server, load balancer, service, or pod.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
