Reserving PVC space for file system overhead

When you add a virtual machine disk to a persistent volume claim (PVC) that uses the Filesystem volume mode, you must ensure that there is enough space on the PVC for the VM disk and for file system overhead, such as metadata.

By default, OpenShift Virtualization reserves 5.5% of the PVC space for overhead, reducing the space available for virtual machine disks by that amount.

You can configure a different overhead value by editing the HCO object. You can change the value globally and you can specify values for specific storage classes.
Overriding the default file system overhead value
Change the amount of persistent volume claim (PVC) space that the OpenShift Virtualization reserves for file system overhead by editing the spec.filesystemOverhead attribute of the HCO object.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Open the HCO object for editing by running the following command:

Edit the spec.filesystemOverhead fields, populating them with your chosen values:

Save and exit the editor to update the HCO object.
