About live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine (VM) to another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload. By default, live migration traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Live migration requirements
Live migration has the following requirements:

The cluster must have shared storage with ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode.

The cluster must have sufficient RAM and network bandwidth.

If a VM uses a host model CPU, the nodes must support the CPU.

Configuring a dedicated Multus network for live migration is highly recommended. A dedicated network minimizes the effects of network saturation on tenant workloads during migration.
