Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage

Logical volume manager storage (LVM Storage) uses the TopoLVM CSI driver to dynamically provision local storage on single-node OpenShift clusters.

LVM Storage creates thin-provisioned volumes using Logical Volume Manager and provides dynamic provisioning of block storage on a limited resources single-node OpenShift cluster.
Deploying LVM Storage on single-node OpenShift clusters
You can deploy LVM Storage on a single-node OpenShift bare-metal or user-provisioned infrastructure cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

LVM Storage creates a volume group using all the available unused disks and creates a single thin pool with a size of 90% of the volume group. The remaining 10% of the volume group is left free to enable data recovery by expanding the thin pool when required. You might need to manually perform such recovery.

You can use persistent volume claims (PVCs) and volume snapshots provisioned by LVM Storage to request storage and create volume snapshots.

LVM Storage configures a default overprovisioning limit of 10 to take advantage of the thin-provisioning feature. The total size of the volumes and volume snapshots that can be created on the single-node OpenShift clusters is 10 times the size of the thin pool.

You can deploy LVM Storage on single-node OpenShift clusters using one of the following:

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Web Console


Requirements
Before you begin deploying LVM Storage on single-node OpenShift clusters, ensure that the following requirements are met:

You have installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

Every managed single-node OpenShift cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage.


Before you deploy LVM Storage on single-node OpenShift clusters, be aware of the following limitations:

You can only create a single instance of the LVMCluster custom resource (CR) on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

When a device becomes part of the LVMCluster CR, it cannot be removed.
Limitations
For deploying single-node OpenShift, LVM Storage has the following limitations:

The total storage size is limited by the size of the underlying Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the overprovisioning factor.

The size of the logical volume depends on the size of the Physical Extent (PE) and the Logical Extent (LE).

Installing LVM Storage using RHACM
LVM Storage is deployed on single-node OpenShift clusters using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM). You create a Policy object on RHACM that deploys and configures the Operator when it is applied to managed clusters which match the selector specified in the PlacementRule resource. The policy is also applied to clusters that are imported later and satisfy the placement rule.

Access to the RHACM cluster using an account with cluster-admin and Operator installation permissions.

Dedicated disks on each single-node OpenShift cluster to be used by LVM Storage.

The single-node OpenShift cluster needs to be managed by RHACM, either imported or created.


Log in to the RHACM CLI using your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" credentials.

Create a namespace in which you will create policies.

To create a policy, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as policy-lvms-operator.yaml:

Create the policy in the namespace by running the following command:


Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes: Installing while connected online

LVM Storage reference YAML file
Uninstalling LVM Storage installed using RHACM
To uninstall LVM Storage that you installed using RHACM, you need to delete the RHACM policy that you created for deploying and configuring the Operator.

When you delete the RHACM policy, the resources that the policy has created are not removed. You need to create additional policies to remove the resources.

As the created resources are not removed when you delete the policy, you need to perform the following steps:

Remove all the Persistent volume claims (PVCs) and volume snapshots provisioned by LVM Storage.

Remove the LVMCluster resources to clean up Logical Volume Manager resources created on the disks.

Create an additional policy to uninstall the Operator.


Ensure that the following are deleted before deleting the policy:

Ensure you have access to the RHACM cluster using an account with a cluster-admin role.


In the OpenShift CLI (oc), delete the RHACM policy that you created for deploying and configuring LVM Storage on the hub cluster by using the following command:

To create a policy for removing the LVMCluster resource, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as lvms-remove-policy.yaml.
This enables the Operator to clean up all Logical Volume Manager resources that it created on the cluster.

Set the value of the PlacementRule.spec.clusterSelector field to select the clusters from which to uninstall LVM Storage.

Create the policy by running the following command:

To create a policy to check if the LVMCluster CR has been removed, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as check-lvms-remove-policy.yaml:

Create the policy by running the following command:

Check the policy status by running the following command:

After both the policies are compliant, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as lvms-uninstall-policy.yaml to create a policy to uninstall LVM Storage.

Create the policy by running the following command:


LVM Storage reference YAML file
Creating a Logical Volume Manager cluster on a single-node OpenShift worker node
You can configure a single-node OpenShift worker node as a Logical Volume Manager cluster. On the control-plane single-node OpenShift node, LVM Storage detects and uses the additional worker nodes when the new nodes become active in the cluster.

When you create a Logical Volume Manager cluster, StorageClass and LVMVolumeGroup resources work together to provide dynamic provisioning of storage. StorageClass CRs define the properties of the storage that you can dynamically provision. LVMVolumeGroup is a specific type of persistent volume (PV) that is backed by an LVM Volume Group. LVMVolumeGroup CRs provide the back-end storage for the persistent volumes that you create.
Perform the following procedure to create a Logical Volume Manager cluster on a single-node OpenShift worker node.

You also can perform the same task by using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console.
You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You installed LVM Storage in a single-node OpenShift cluster and have installed a worker node for use in the single-node OpenShift cluster.


Create the LVMCluster custom resource (CR).


Verify that the LVMCluster resource has created the StorageClass, LVMVolumeGroup, and LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus CRs.

LVMVolumeGroup and LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus are managed by LVM Storage. Do not edit these CRs directly.
Check that the LVMCluster CR is in a ready state by running the following command:

Check that the storage class is created:

Check that the volume snapshot class is created:

Check that the LVMVolumeGroup resource is created:

Check that the LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus resource is created:


Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters

LVM Storage reference YAML file
Adding a storage class
You can add a storage class to an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. A storage class describes a class of storage in the cluster and how the cluster dynamically provisions the persistent volumes (PVs) when the user specifies the storage class. A storage class describes the type of device classes, the quality-of-service level, the filesystem type, and other details.

Create a YAML file:

Apply the YAML file by using the oc command:

Verify that the cluster created the storage class by using the following command:
Provisioning storage using LVM Storage
You can provision persistent volume claims (PVCs) using the storage class that is created during the Operator installation. You can provision block and file PVCs, however, the storage is allocated only when a pod that uses the PVC is created.

LVM Storage provisions PVCs in units of 1 GiB. The requested storage is rounded up to the nearest GiB.
Identify the StorageClass that is created when LVM Storage is deployed.

To create a PVC where the application requires storage, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as pvc.yaml.

Create the PVC by running the following command:
Monitoring LVM Storage
When LVM Storage is installed using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Web Console, you can monitor the cluster by using the Block and File dashboard in the console by default. However, when you use RHACM to install LVM Storage, you need to configure RHACM Observability to monitor all the single-node OpenShift clusters from one place.

Metrics
You can monitor LVM Storage by viewing the metrics exported by the Operator on the RHACM dashboards and the alerts that are triggered.

Add the following topolvm metrics to the allow list:


Metrics are updated every 10 minutes or when there is a change in the thin pool, such as a new logical volume creation.
Alerts
When the thin pool and volume group are filled up, further operations fail and might lead to data loss. LVM Storage sends the following alerts about the usage of the thin pool and volume group when utilization crosses a certain value:




Observability

Adding custom metrics
Scaling storage of single-node OpenShift clusters
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" supports additional worker nodes for single-node OpenShift clusters on bare-metal user-provisioned infrastructure. LVM Storage detects and uses the new additional worker nodes when the nodes show up.

Scaling up storage by adding capacity to your single-node OpenShift cluster
To scale the storage capacity of your configured worker nodes on a single-node OpenShift cluster, you can increase the capacity by adding disks.

You have additional unused disks on each single-node OpenShift cluster to be used by LVM Storage.


Log in to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" console of the single-node OpenShift cluster.

From the Operators -> Installed Operators page, click on the LVM Storage Operator in the openshift-storage namespace.

Click on the LVMCluster tab to list the LVMCluster CR created on the cluster.

Select Edit LVMCluster from the Actions drop-down menu.

Click on the YAML tab.

Edit the LVMCluster CR YAML to add the new device path in the deviceSelector section:

Scaling up storage by adding capacity to your single-node OpenShift cluster using RHACM
You can scale the storage capacity of your configured worker nodes on a single-node OpenShift cluster using RHACM.

You have access to the RHACM cluster using an account with cluster-admin privileges.

You have additional unused devices on each single-node OpenShift cluster that LVM Storage can use.


Log in to the RHACM CLI using your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" credentials.

Find the device that you want to add. The device to be added needs to match with the device name and path of the existing devices.

To add capacity to the single-node OpenShift cluster, edit the deviceSelector section of the existing policy YAML, for example, policy-lvms-operator.yaml.

Edit the policy by running the following command:


Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes: Installing while connected online

LVM Storage reference YAML file
Expanding PVCs
To leverage the new storage after adding additional capacity, you can expand existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) with LVM Storage.

Dynamic provisioning is used.

The controlling StorageClass object has allowVolumeExpansion set to true.


Modify the .spec.resources.requests.storage field in the desired PVC resource to the new size by running the following command:

Watch the status.conditions field of the PVC to see if the resize has completed. "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" adds the Resizing condition to the PVC during expansion, which is removed after the expansion completes.

Upgrading LVM Storage on single-node OpenShift clusters
Currently, it is not possible to upgrade from OpenShift Data Foundation Logical Volume Manager Operator 4.11 to LVM Storage 4.12 on single-node OpenShift clusters.

The data will not be preserved during this process.
Back up any data that you want to preserve on the persistent volume claims (PVCs).

Delete all PVCs provisioned by the OpenShift Data Foundation Logical Volume Manager Operator and their pods.

Reinstall LVM Storage on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.12.

Recreate the workloads.

Copy the backup data to the PVCs created after upgrading to 4.12.
Volume snapshots for single-node OpenShift
You can take volume snapshots of persistent volumes (PVs) that are provisioned by LVM Storage. You can also create volume snapshots of the cloned volumes. Volume snapshots help you to do the following:

Back up your application data.

Revert to a state at which the volume snapshot was taken.


OADP features


Creating volume snapshots in single-node OpenShift
You can create volume snapshots based on the available capacity of the thin pool and the overprovisioning limits. LVM Storage creates a VolumeSnapshotClass with the lvms-<deviceclass-name> name.

You ensured that the persistent volume claim (PVC) is in Bound state. This is required for a consistent snapshot.

You stopped all the I/O to the PVC before taking the snapshot.


Log in to the single-node OpenShift for which you need to run the oc command.

Save the following YAML to a file with a name such as lvms-vol-snapshot.yaml.

Create the snapshot by running the following command in the same namespace as the PVC:


A read-only copy of the PVC is created as a volume snapshot.
Restoring volume snapshots in single-node OpenShift
When you restore a volume snapshot, a new persistent volume claim (PVC) is created. The restored PVC is independent of the volume snapshot and the source PVC.

The storage class must be the same as that of the source PVC.

The size of the requested PVC must be the same as that of the source volume of the snapshot.


Identify the storage class name of the source PVC and volume snapshot name.

Save the following YAML to a file with a name such as lvms-vol-restore.yaml to restore the snapshot.

Create the policy by running the following command in the same namespace as the snapshot:
Deleting volume snapshots in single-node OpenShift
You can delete volume snapshots resources and persistent volume claims (PVCs).

Delete the volume snapshot resource by running the following command:

To delete the restored volume snapshot, delete the PVC that was created to restore the volume snapshot by running the following command:
Volume cloning for single-node OpenShift
A clone is a duplicate of an existing storage volume that can be used like any standard volume.

Creating volume clones in single-node OpenShift
You create a clone of a volume to make a point-in-time copy of the data. A persistent volume claim (PVC) cannot be cloned with a different size.

The cloned PVC has write access.
You ensured that the PVC is in Bound state. This is required for a consistent snapshot.

You ensured that the StorageClass is the same as that of the source PVC.


Identify the storage class of the source PVC.

To create a volume clone, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as lvms-vol-clone.yaml:

Create the policy in the same namespace as the source PVC by running the following command:
