Restarting the cluster gracefully

This document describes the process to restart your cluster after a graceful shutdown.

Even though the cluster is expected to be functional after the restart, the cluster might not recover due to unexpected conditions, for example:

etcd data corruption during shutdown

Node failure due to hardware

Network connectivity issues


If your cluster fails to recover, follow the steps to restore to a previous cluster state.
Prerequisites
You have gracefully shut down your cluster.
Restarting the cluster
You can restart your cluster after it has been shut down gracefully.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

This procedure assumes that you gracefully shut down the cluster.


Power on any cluster dependencies, such as external storage or an LDAP server.

Start all cluster machines.

Verify that all control plane nodes are ready.

If the control plane nodes are not ready, then check whether there are any pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) that must be approved.

After the control plane nodes are ready, verify that all worker nodes are ready.

If the worker nodes are not ready, then check whether there are any pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) that must be approved.

Verify that the cluster started properly.


If the cluster did not start properly, you might need to restore your cluster using an etcd backup.

See Restoring to a previous cluster state for how to use an etcd backup to restore if your cluster failed to recover after restarting.
