Installing the distributed tracing platform Jaeger

You can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" in either of two ways:

You can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Distributed tracing is included by default in the Service Mesh installation. To install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform as part of a service mesh, follow the Red Hat Service Mesh Installation instructions. You must install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the ServiceMeshControlPlane and the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform resources must be in the same namespace.

If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operators to install distributed tracing platform by itself. To install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform without a service mesh, use the following instructions.
Prerequisites
Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform, review the installation activities, and ensure that you meet the prerequisites:

Possess an active "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.

Review the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} overview.

Install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}.

Install the version of the oc CLI tool that matches your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version and add it to your path.

An account with the cluster-admin role.
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform installation overview
The steps for installing Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform are as follows:

Review the documentation and determine your deployment strategy.

If your deployment strategy requires persistent storage, install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator via the OperatorHub.

Install the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator via the OperatorHub.

Modify the custom resource YAML file to support your deployment strategy.

Deploy one or more instances of Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" environment.
Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
The default Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform, giving demonstrations, or using Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in a test environment. If you plan to use Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

You have access to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.


Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
Log in to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

Navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type Elasticsearch into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

Click the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

Click Install.

On the Install Operator page, select the stable Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

Accept the default All namespaces on the cluster (default). This installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators-redhat project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

Accept the default Automatic approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select Manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

Click Install.

On the Installed Operators page, select the openshift-operators-redhat project. Wait until you see that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.
Installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator
To install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), you use the OperatorHub to install the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.

By default, the Operator is installed in the openshift-operators project.

You have access to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

If you require persistent storage, you must also install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.


Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
Log in to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

Navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type distributed tracing platform into the filter to locate the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

Click Install.

On the Install Operator page, select the stable Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

Accept the default All namespaces on the cluster (default). This installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

Click Install.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

On the Installed Operators page, select the openshift-operators project. Wait until you see that the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator shows a status of "Succeeded" before continuing.
