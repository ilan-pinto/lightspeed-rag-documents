New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

See the Releases page in the openshift/okd project repository for information on the latest OKD releases.
Operators
Operators are pieces of software that ease the operational complexity of running another piece of software. They act like an extension of the software vendor's engineering team, watching over a Kubernetes environment (such as "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform") and using its current state to make decisions in real time. Advanced Operators are designed to handle upgrades seamlessly, react to failures automatically, and not take shortcuts, like skipping a software backup process to save time.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
This feature is now fully supported in OpenShift v4.

The OLM aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster:

Includes a catalog of curated Operators, with the ability to load other Operators into the cluster

Handles rolling updates of all Operators to new versions

Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for certain teams to use certain Operators


See Understanding the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) for more information.
Installation and upgrade
Red Hat OpenShift v4 has an installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program controls all areas of the installation process. Installer-provisioned infrastructure also provides an opinionated best practices deployment of OpenShift v4 for AWS instances only. This provides a slimmer default installation, with incremental feature buy-in through OperatorHub.

You can also install with a user-provided infrastructure on AWS, bare metal, or vSphere hosts. If you use the installer-provisioned infrastructure installation, the cluster provisions and manages all of the cluster infrastructure for you.

Upgrading from 3.x to 4 is currently not available. You must perform a new installation of OpenShift v4.

Easy, over-the-air upgrades for asynchronous z-stream releases of OpenShift v4 is available. Cluster administrators can upgrade using the Cluster Settings tab in the web console. See Updating a cluster for more information.

OperatorHub
OperatorHub is available to administrators and helps with easy discovery and installation of all optional components and applications. It includes offerings from Red Hat products, Red Hat partners, and the community.


See Understanding the OperatorHub for more information.
Storage
Storage support in OpenShift v4 is the same as OpenShift v3 with the exception of the following available in Technology Preview: EFS (CSI Driver handled via Amazon), Manila provisioner/operator, and Snapshot.
Scale
Cluster maximums
Updated guidance around Cluster maximums for OpenShift v4 is now available.

Use the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Limit Calculator to estimate cluster limits for your environment.
Node Tuning Operator
The Node Tuning Operator is now part of a standard "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation in OpenShift v4.

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the tuned daemon. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning, which is currently a Technology Preview feature, specified by user needs. The Operator manages the containerized tuned daemon for OpenShift Container Platform as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized tuned daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.
Cluster monitoring
New alerting user interface
An alerting UI is now natively integrated into the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console. You can now view cluster-level alerts and alerting rules from a single place, as well as configure silences.
Telemeter
Telemeter collects anonymized cluster-related metrics to proactively help customers with their "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters. This helps:

Gather crucial health metrics of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installations.

Enable a viable feedback loop of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" upgrades.

Gather the cluster's number of nodes per cluster and their size (CPU cores and
RAM).

Gather the size of etcd.

Gather details about the health condition and status for any OpenShift framework
component installed on an OpenShift cluster.
Autoscale pods horizontally based on the resource metrics API
By default, OpenShift Cluster Monitoring exposes CPU and Memory utilization through the Kubernetes resource metrics API. There is no longer a requirement to install a separate metrics server.
Developer experience
Multi-stage Dockerfile Builds Generally Available
Multi-stage Dockerfiles are now supported in all Docker strategy builds.
Registry
The registry is now managed by an Operator
The registry is now managed by an Operator instead of oc adm registry.
Networking
Cluster Network Operator (CNO)
The cluster network is now configured and managed by an Operator. The Operator upgrades and monitors the cluster network.
OpenShift SDN
The default mode is now NetworkPolicy.
Multus
Multus is a meta plugin for Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI), which enables a user to create multiple network interfaces per pod.
SR-IOV
OpenShift v4 includes the Technical Preview capability to use specific SR-IOV hardware on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" nodes, which enables the user to attach SR-IOV virtual function (VF) interfaces to Pods in addition to other network interfaces.
F5 router plugin support
F5 router plugin is no longer supported as part of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" directly. However, F5 has developed a container connector that replaces the functionality. It is recommended to work with F5 support to implement their solution.
Web console
Developer Catalog
OpenShift v4 features a redesigned Developer Catalog that brings all of the new Operators and existing broker services together, with new ways to discover, sort, and understand how to best use each type of offering. The Developer Catalog is the entry point for a developer to access all services available to them. It merges all capabilities from Operators, the Service Catalog, brokers, and Source-to-Image (S2I).
New management screens
New management screens in OpenShift v4 support automated operations. Examples include the management of machine sets and machines, taints, tolerations, and cluster settings.
Security
In OpenShift v4, Operators are utilized to install, configure, and manage the various certificate signing servers. Certificates are managed as secrets stored within the cluster itself.
