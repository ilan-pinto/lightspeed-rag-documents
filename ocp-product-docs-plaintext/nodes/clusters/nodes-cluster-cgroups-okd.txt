Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes

By default, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in your cluster. You can switch to Linux control group version 1 (cgroup v1), if needed.

cgroup v2 is the next version of the kernel control group and offers multiple improvements. However, it can have some unwanted effects on your nodes.

You can switch to Linux control group version 1 (cgroup v1), if needed, by using a machine config. Enabling cgroup v1 in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" disables the cgroup v2 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster.

Have administrative privilege to a working "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.


Create a MachineConfig object file that identifies the kernel argument (for example, worker-cgroup-v1.yaml)

Create the new machine config:

Check to see that the new machine config was added:

Check the nodes:

After a node returns to the Ready state, start a debug session for that node:

Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell:

Check that the sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup2fs file has been moved to the tmpfs file system:
