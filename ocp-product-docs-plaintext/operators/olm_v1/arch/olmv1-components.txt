Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 comprises the following component projects:


Operator Controller
Operator Controller is the central component of OLM 1.0 that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from each of the following components.
RukPak
RukPak is a pluggable solution for packaging and distributing cloud-native content. It supports advanced strategies for installation, updates, and policy.
Catalogd
Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the OLM 1.0 microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
