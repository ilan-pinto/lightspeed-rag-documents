Logging using LokiStack

In logging subsystem documentation, LokiStack refers to the logging subsystem supported combination of Loki and web proxy with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" authentication integration. LokiStack's proxy uses "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" authentication to enforce multi-tenancy. Loki refers to the log store as either the individual component or an external store.

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system currently offered as an alternative to Elasticsearch as a log store for the logging subsystem. Elasticsearch indexes incoming log records completely during ingestion. Loki only indexes a few fixed labels during ingestion and defers more complex parsing until after the logs have been stored. This means Loki can collect logs more quickly. You can query Loki by using the LogQL log query language.
Loki deployment sizing
Sizing for Loki follows the format of <N>x.<size> where the value <N> is number of instances and <size> specifies performance capabilities.
Deploying the Loki Operator using the web console
You can use the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console to install the Loki Operator.

To install the Loki Operator using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console:

In the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type Loki in the Filter by keyword field.

Select stable or stable-5.y as the Update channel.

Ensure that All namespaces on the cluster is selected under Installation mode.

Ensure that openshift-operators-redhat is selected under Installed Namespace.

Select Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace.

Select an option for Update approval.

Click Install.

Verify that the LokiOperator installed by switching to the Operators → Installed Operators page.

Create a Secret YAML file that uses the access_key_id and access_key_secret fields to specify your credentials and bucketnames, endpoint, and region to define the object storage location. AWS is used in the following example:

Select Create instance under LokiStack on the Details tab. Then select YAML view. Paste in the following template, subsituting values where appropriate.

Create or edit a ClusterLogging CR:
Creating a new group for the cluster-admin user role
Querying application logs for multiple namespaces as a cluster-admin user, where the sum total of characters of all of the namespaces in the cluster is greater than 5120, results in the error Parse error: input size too long (XXXX > 5120). For better control over access to logs in LokiStack, make the cluster-admin user a member of the cluster-admin group. If the cluster-admin group does not exist, create it and add the desired users to it.
Use the following procedure to create a new group for users with cluster-admin permissions.

Enter the following command to create a new group:

Enter the following command to add the desired user to the cluster-admin group:

Installing logging Operators using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console
To install and configure logging on your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the Operator Hub within the web console.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operator’s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

Supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation)


Install the Loki Operator:


As the Loki Operator must be deployed to the global operator group namespace openshift-operators-redhat, Installation mode and Installed Namespace is already be selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

Select Enable operator-recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.


This option sets the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.

For Update approval select Automatic, then click Install.

In the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type OpenShift Logging in the filter by keyword box. Choose Red Hat OpenShift Logging from the list of available Operators and click Install.

On the Install Operator page, under Update channel select stable.


As the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator is only deployable to the openshift-logging namespace, Installation mode and Installed Namespace is already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

If you are creating the openshift-logging namespace, select the option to Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace.

Under Update approval select Automatic.

For Console plugin select Enable, then click Install.


The Operators should now be available to all users and projects that use this cluster.

LokiStack behavior during cluster restarts
In logging version 5.8 and newer versions, when an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster is restarted, LokiStack ingestion and the query path continue to operate within the available CPU and memory resources available for the node. This means that there is no downtime for the LokiStack during "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster updates. This behavior is achieved by using PodDisruptionBudget resources. The Loki Operator provisions PodDisruptionBudget resources for Loki, which determine the minimum number of pods that must be available per component to ensure normal operations under certain conditions.

Pod disruption budgets Kubernetes documentation
Configuring Loki to tolerate node failure
In the logging subsystem 5.8 and later versions, the Loki Operator supports setting pod anti-affinity rules to request that pods of the same component are scheduled on different available nodes in the cluster.

Affinity is a property of pods that controls the nodes on which they prefer to be scheduled. Anti-affinity is a property of pods that prevents a pod from being scheduled on a node.

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", pod affinity and pod anti-affinity allow you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on based on the key-value labels on other pods.

The Operator sets default, preferred podAntiAffinity rules for all Loki components, which includes the compactor, distributor, gateway, indexGateway, ingester, querier, queryFrontend, and ruler components.

You can override the preferred podAntiAffinity settings for Loki components by configuring required settings in the requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution field:

apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
# ...
  template:
    ingester:
      podAntiAffinity:
      # ...
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 1
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels: 2
              app.kubernetes.io/component: ingester
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
# ...
The stanza to define a required rule.

The key-value pair (label) that must be matched to apply the rule.

Zone aware data replication
In the logging subsystem 5.8 and later versions, the Loki Operator offers support for zone-aware data replication through pod topology spread constraints. Enabling this feature enhances reliability and safeguards against log loss in the event of a single zone failure. When configuring the deployment size as 1x.extra.small, 1x.small, or 1x.medium, the replication.factor field is automatically set to 2.

To ensure proper replication, you need to have at least as many availability zones as the replication factor specifies. While it is possible to have more availability zones than the replication factor, having fewer zones can lead to write failures. Each zone should host an equal number of instances for optimal operation.

apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
 name: logging-loki
 namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
 replicationFactor: 2 1
 replication:
   factor: 2 2
   zones:
   -  maxSkew: 1 3
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone 4
Deprecated field, values entered are overwritten by replication.factor.

This value is automatically set when deployment size is selected at setup.

The maximum difference in number of pods between any two topology domains. The default is 1, and you cannot specify a value of 0.

Defines zones in the form of a topology key that corresponds to a node label.


Recovering Loki pods from failed zones
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" a zone failure happens when specific availability zone resources become inaccessible. Availability zones are isolated areas within a cloud provider's data center, aimed at enhancing redundancy and fault tolerance. If your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster isn't configured to handle this, a zone failure can lead to service or data loss.

Loki pods are part of a StatefulSet, and they come with Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) provisioned by a StorageClass object. Each Loki pod and its PVCs reside in the same zone. When a zone failure occurs in a cluster, the StatefulSet controller automatically attempts to recover the affected pods in the failed zone.

The following procedure will delete the PVCs in the failed zone, and all data contained therein.  To avoid complete data loss the replication factor field of the LokiStack CR should always be set to a value greater than 1 to ensure that Loki is replicating.
Logging version 5.8 or later.

Verify your LokiStack CR has a replication factor greater than 1.

Zone failure detected by the control plane, and nodes in the failed zone are marked by cloud provider integration.


The StatefulSet controller automatically attempts to reschedule pods in a failed zone. Because the associated PVCs are also in the failed zone, automatic rescheduling to a different zone does not work. You must manually delete the PVCs in the failed zone to allow successful re-creation of the stateful Loki Pod and its provisioned PVC in the new zone.

List the pods in Pending status by running the following command:


oc delete pod __<pod_name>__  -n openshift-logging
Once these objects have been successfully deleted, they should automatically be rescheduled in an available zone.

Troubleshooting PVC in a terminating state
The PVCs might hang in the terminating state without being deleted, if PVC metadata finalizers are set to kubernetes.io/pv-protection. Removing the finalizers should allow the PVCs to delete successfully.

Remove the finalizer for each PVC by running the command below, then retry deletion.


oc patch pvc __<pvc_name>__ -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' -n openshift-logging

Fine grained access for Loki logs
In logging subsystem 5.8 and later, the ClusterLogging Operator does not grant all users access to logs by default.  As an administrator, you need to configure your users access unless the Operator was upgraded and prior configurations are in place. Depending on your configuration and need, you can configure fine grain access to logs using the following:

Cluster wide policies

Namespace scoped policies

Creation of custom admin groups


As an administrator, you need to create the role bindings and cluster role bindings appropriate for your deployment. The ClusterLogging Operator provides the following cluster roles:

cluster-logging-application-view grants permission to read application logs.

cluster-logging-infrastructure-view grants permission to read infrastructure logs.

cluster-logging-audit-view grants permission to read audit logs.


If you have upgraded from a prior version, an additional cluster role logging-application-logs-reader and associated cluster role binding logging-all-authenticated-application-logs-reader provide backward compatibility, allowing any authenticated user read access in their namespaces.

Users with access by namespace must provide a namespace when querying application logs.
Cluster wide access
Cluster role binding resources reference cluster roles, and set permissions cluster wide.

kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: logging-all-application-logs-reader
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-logging-application-view 1
subjects: 2
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Additional ClusterRoles are cluster-logging-infrastructure-view, and cluster-logging-audit-view.

Specifies the users or groups this object applies to.
Namespaced access
RoleBinding resources can be used with ClusterRole objects to define the namespace a user or group has access to logs for.

kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-read-logs
  namespace: log-test-0 1
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-logging-application-view
subjects:
- kind: User
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  name: testuser-0
Specifies the namespace this RoleBinding applies to.
Custom admin group access
If you have a large deployment with a number of users who require broader permissions, you can create a custom group using the adminGroup field. Users who are members of any group specified in the adminGroups field of the LokiStack CR are considered admins. Admin users have access to all application logs in all namespaces, if they also get assigned the cluster-logging-application-view role.

apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging 1
    openshift:
      adminGroups: 2
      - cluster-admin
      - custom-admin-group 3
Custom admin groups are only available in this mode.

Entering an empty list [] value for this field disables admin groups.

Overrides the default groups (system:cluster-admins, cluster-admin, dedicated-admin)
Enabling stream-based retention with Loki
With Logging version 5.6 and higher, you can configure retention policies based on log streams. Rules for these may be set globally, per tenant, or both. If you configure both, tenant rules apply before global rules.

To enable stream-based retention, create a LokiStack custom resource (CR):

Apply the LokiStack CR:


This is not for managing the retention for stored logs. Global retention periods for stored logs to a supported maximum of 30 days is configured with your object storage.
Forwarding logs to LokiStack
To configure log forwarding to the LokiStack gateway, you must create a ClusterLogging custom resource (CR).

The Logging subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift version 5.5 or newer is installed on your cluster.

The Loki Operator is installed on your cluster.


Create a ClusterLogging custom resource (CR):


Troubleshooting Loki rate limit errors
If the Log Forwarder API forwards a large block of messages that exceeds the rate limit to Loki, Loki generates rate limit (429) errors.

These errors can occur during normal operation. For example, when adding the logging subsystem to a cluster that already has some logs, rate limit errors might occur while the logging subsystem tries to ingest all of the existing log entries. In this case, if the rate of addition of new logs is less than the total rate limit, the historical data is eventually ingested, and the rate limit errors are resolved without requiring user intervention.

In cases where the rate limit errors continue to occur, you can fix the issue by modifying the LokiStack custom resource (CR).

The LokiStack CR is not available on Grafana-hosted Loki. This topic does not apply to Grafana-hosted Loki servers.
The Log Forwarder API is configured to forward logs to Loki.

Your system sends a block of messages that is larger than 2 MB to Loki. For example:

After you enter oc logs -n openshift-logging -l component=collector, the collector logs in your cluster show a line containing one of the following error messages:
